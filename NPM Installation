To install the node.js
Step1: Download the required file from https://nodejs.org/en/
file name:node-v8.11.3-x64.msi
Step2: Provide the separate installation you want to give. 
Path given: S:\Software Execution\nodejs

After the installation is complete. S:\Software Execution\nodejs\ will be automatically added to the System path variable. 

You can check it by running npm command in command prompt. 

While installing node, npm and node both are installed. 
You can check their versions by using following command. 
c:> npm -v  // 5.6.0
c:> node -v // v8.11.3

To install angular run, following command. 
 npm install –g @angular/cli
 
 run ng -v to check the angular installation. 
 
 -g is used to install angular CLI globally.
 
 And, g is used install angular CLI in particular folder. 
 
 To create a new project:
 ng new <projectname>
 S:\Learning\Angular\Angular4>ng new angular1-app
 
 It will create the structure of the angular app. 
 
 So, angular CLI reduced the plight of creating the structure all by yourself that I used to do in angular1. 
 
 Project Compiltation command: ng serve
 
 "ng serve" command compiles the project and start the server on port 4200. 
 
 Note: Run this ng serve command on the particular project. 
 
 S:\Learning\Angular\Angular4\angular1-app>ng serve
 
 
 Then, run your application through following URL: http://localhost:4200/
 
 Command to change the port: ng serve --host 0.0.0.0 –port 4205
