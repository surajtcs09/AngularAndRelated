1. Issue: More than one module matches.
Error: More than one module matches. Use skip-import option to skip importing the component into the closest module
Solution:
This issue occurs when we try to create a component and there are multiple module.ts file to register it. 
e.g. > ng g c shared\_component\alert
There is app.module.ts and shared.module.ts to register. 
CLI gets confused that's why this issue

> ng g c shared\_component\alert --module shared

2. Issue: By mistake component created in wrong folder
First delete the component in corresponding module.ts 
And, then manually delete the folder 

One can check how many files are affected while creation, run following command
> ng g c shared\_component\alert --module shared --dry--run
